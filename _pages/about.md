* I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student (9/2019-) in the [School of Electronic Science and Engineering](https://ese.nju.edu.cn/ese_en/main.htm) at [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/EN/main.htm), supervised by Prof. **[Haibo Zhou](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=zu9EFX4AAAAJ&hl=en)** and Prof. **[Quan Yu](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=gZF6mTsAAAAJ&hl=en)**. 

*  My research interests lie in designing analytical and resource allocation methods in the general areas of wireless communications (e.g., **stochastic geometry, machine learning, and non-convex optimization**), particularly in **vehicular networks, MIMO beamforming**, and **IoTs** in the future wireless network. 
* I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree (9/2015-6/2019) in Information Science and Technology, [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/).
